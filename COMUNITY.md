We are an engineering centric community:
------------------------------------

We accept anyone into our community, regardless of race, gender, corporate affilliation, lack of corporate affilliation, age, education, experience, or ability to spell.  The only thing of important to us is your ability to think like an engineer.

We are an emotional community:
----------------------------

Despite our engineering focus, we recognise that people are people and that people have emotions.  It is OK to get angry or passionate.  If you *feel* stressed or anxious about something, tell us.  When you feel something, negative or positive, try to tell us, not only your feelings, but why you feel that way as well.

We will not tollerate:
------------------

 - Racism
 - Sexism
 - Threats
